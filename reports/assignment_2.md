Q1. What are 2 things that you learned from this assignment?
A1: The main learning was how polling works, what is the practical use of it. Second point was what are semaphores, how mutual exclusion works
    how to implement semphores and polling.

Q2. What are 2 mistakes that you made in this assignment, and how did you discover and fix these mistakes?
A2: The two main mistakes were not updating the round and the process ID after each decrease in the value. This I discovered when I got 
    segmentation fault. So I started passsing the current round, current process ID and the entire array to the calling function by reference.

Q3. If you were restarting this assignment, what would you change about how you went about completing this assignment?
A3: This time I started coding directly seeing the examples so it took me a long time to debug the error and implement the concept as 
    I had limited understanding of the concept. If I restart, I would understand how polling and semaphore works properly and then start 
    implementing. I would use a dog-house approach to solve the problem.
